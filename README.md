# About
PictureThese is a website where users can upload an image and get what was detected by the Google Vision API displayed directly on the image. Users can also choose to translate the output with the Google Translate API as well as hear their pronounciations using the Web Speech API.

Built by a team of Claudio Vertemara, Kevin Piffero, Jesus Andres Bernal Lopez, and Noah Tolentino Nguyen as a fun and interactive way to learn how things are said in other languages. 

This website was made as our final project for CST 205 - Multimedia Design and Programming taken during Spring 2019.
